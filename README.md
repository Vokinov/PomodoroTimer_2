### üí° Why I Created This

The Pomodoro Timer is designed for anyone looking to boost productivity and stay focused. It's based on the **Pomodoro Technique**, developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The core ideas behind the technique are:

1. Estimate how much time a task will take.
2. Stay focused while completing it.
3. Take breaks to clear your mind.
4. Track time spent on both tasks and breaks.
5. Review progress regularly.
6. Use these patterns to achieve personal or professional goals.
